# JBump Example Projects

Two projects to demonstrate the use of Jbump with libGDX. This project is a supplementary to the
[tutorial video](https://youtu.be/IeU06Vzz2hA).

Jbump is a collision detection library based on AABB calculations. Please review the
[documentation here](https://github.com/tommyettinger/jbump).

The first project included is Super M'hario Bros and shows you how you can make a simple platformer using Jbump. To run
this project, use Gradle command `lwjgl3-platformer:run`. Use the arrow keys to move.

The second project included is Laser Tank and shows you how to implement Jbump in a top-down shooter. To run this
project, use Gradle command `lwjgl3-tank:run`. Use the arrow keys to move, aim with the mouse, and left click to shoot.

Please read the comments within the projects to understand how the code is divided. These games break some conventions
for the sake of simplicity. You should check the [libGDX Awesome List](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx) for resources on best practices and other valuable
libGDX libraries and tools.
